# Dynamic Programming in Java 🇮🇳

This repository contains a collection of practical Java programs that demonstrate various **Dynamic Programming** techniques. These are some of the most common problems asked in technical interviews and competitive programming contests.

The idea behind this repo is to help learners understand how to break down complex problems into sub-problems using dynamic programming — with clear and working Java implementations.

## 📘 Topics Covered

This repo includes Java programs for:

* 🧳 **0/1 Knapsack Problem**
* 🧮 **Unbounded Knapsack**
* 🔁 **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**
* 📐 **Matrix Chain Multiplication**
* 🧭 **Backtracking Techniques**
* 🌐 **Graph-based DP Problems**

All programs are coded in a clean and beginner-friendly way with focus on logic clarity rather than shortcuts or advanced tricks.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sagarunhale2294/Dynamic-Programming.git
cd Dynamic-Programming
```

2. Open in any Java IDE (like IntelliJ, Eclipse) or compile directly:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```

Each program is self-contained and includes input/output examples in comments.
